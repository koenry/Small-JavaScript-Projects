# Vue IMDB Movie APP

## Used OMDBAPI
#### A fun project I made to play around with APIS and a new framework - VUE. Learned about backend servers, nodejs, npm, components, .env, gitignore and well VUE.
#### A simple app which lookups a movie title from imdb and gets you its release date, poster and imdb metacritic and rt ratings.
#### Also a fun button to play around which gets you a random superhero movie
#### I have hosted a live demon on nettlify: https://koenry-vue-movie-app.netlify.app/
